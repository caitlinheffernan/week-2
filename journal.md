**Volunteers and Ethics**

I think the greatest thing about Transcribe Bentham and similar projects is the win-win situation it creates for volunteers and researchers - volunteers can witness important and interesting historical artifacts as well as contribute to meaningful research regardless of their background or education, and researchers benefit from the high-quality yet cost-effective work of the volunteers. Their goal of opening up the field of history is one I really support. The eliteness of some parts of academia can be alienating for people outside of it. 

That being said, the ethics of crowdsourcing isn't something I had previously considered. I always just thought they were cool opportunities for the public to be involved with projects and tasks they usually don't have access to. But I can see how volunteers could also be exploited, or how they could feel that way. Researchers need to think about where the line is. I understand that that line could be ambiguous, but I guess, as was the case with Transcribe Bentham, there's a limit to how much specialized knowledge you can ask of volunteers. It's one thing to learn how to use transcribing software and how to encode TEI tags, but another to ask them to moderate other people's work (especially when the moderating role was previously filled by paid employees). However, in general I think the conclusion drawn from the readings (that volunteers won't feel exploited if they are supported, feel they are making a meaningful contribution, and having fun) is reasonable. 

**Resources at Carleton**

I've never really looked at what kind of resources Carleton gives us access to besides academic journal articles and newspaper databases. But just now I looked for what kind of historical/archival resources we have access to and there's quite a few. They all seem fairly straightforward in terms of getting them in readable formats. The main barrier to me would be the sheer volume of databases and archives one can go through. Sometimes the names of the collections aren't super indicative of what their content actually is. I don't think there's an easy way to search through all of these databases at once. So it could be tedious to go through everything that sounds relevant. 

**Where do I fit in the digital history machine?**

I guess I am the kind of person projects like Transcribe Bentham are aimed at. I want to see the primary sources and help make discoveries, I want to actively DO things, but history is just a fun thing I read about sometimes. I don't have the commitment to read journal articles or immerse myself to that extent, but the chance to make a little contribution is exciting. And as a potential-future journalist, maybe someday my work will find its way into the archives of a future digital historian.
