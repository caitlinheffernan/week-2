I made this meme out of frustration while reading the capta vs. data article. I hard a hard time getting through it. I felt like there were so many words and concepts I needed to look up that I was just disoriented.

Now, I don't exactly feel qualified to judge whether this article is *actually* badly written, because
1. I try to avoid reading scholarly articles generally (which is largely possible with at least one of my majors) because I find *most* of them challenging. So maybe I'm just an inexperienced reader.
1. Humanities isn't a field I've done much, if any research in. So who am I to say if it's good. I probably wouldn't know half of what was being written about even if it *was* written more plainly.
1. I have faith that you wouldn't assign an article you thought was badly written!

But still, whenever I come accross a particularly difficult article, I wonder if maybe it could've been slightly less convoluted, or slightly more accessible. What is there to be gained from unnecesarrily complicated writing, even if its intended audience is other academics?
